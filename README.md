## This project is in it's infancy. It is currently grossly out of date but I plan to push it once it works in some semblence.
## Feel free to open an issue, but it you jum straight to a pull request it will likely be denied as it might be incompatable.
## The repo name is also likely to change once I think of a better name for it. Feel free to make suggestions in the issues.
## I also might move developement over to source hut if I ever get a job.
